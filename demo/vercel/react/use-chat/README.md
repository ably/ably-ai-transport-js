# `useChat` demo

A Next.js chat app that plugs Ably AI Transport into the Vercel AI SDK's [`useChat`](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat) hook, via the SDK's `useChatTransport` and `useMessageSync`. Each fresh visit opens a new channel (`?channel=<name>` pins a specific one).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22
- pnpm 11 (`corepack enable` once)
- An [Ably API key](https://ably.com/accounts)
- One AI provider key: Anthropic, OpenAI, or Vercel AI Gateway

## Setup

The demo links the SDK from the repo root (`link:../../../..`) and loads its built `dist/`, so build the SDK first.

```bash
# 1. Build the SDK (from the repository root)
pnpm install

# 2. Configure env (from this directory)
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# then set ABLY_API_KEY + one AI provider key — see the comments in the file

# 3. Install and run (from this directory)
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

## Reflecting SDK changes

The demo loads the SDK's built output, so after editing SDK source:

1. Rebuild from the repo root: `pnpm run build`
2. Restart the dev server (`Ctrl-C`, then `pnpm dev`).
